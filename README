This is a collection of my dotfiles, created for getting a new computer up and
running quickly.  The intent is to check the folder out into my home direcotry,
and then create simlinks from actual dotfile locations to the contents of the
folder.

Feel free to use anything in here in any way, except to the extent that any
of these are GPL.

Files:
setup.sh -- Script to do a first pass at setting up a new Ubuntu computer.  Does many
  things, including taking care of the softlinks for these configuration files and
  installing the relevant application they correspond to.

config.fish -- Configuration file for the fish shell.  Lives in .config/fish
.gitconfig -- Configuaration for git, lives in ~/.gitconfig
.vimrc -- vim configuartion
sakura.conf -- A configuation for the sakura terminal emulator.  The file lives
  in ~/config/sakura
terminator.config -- Configuration for Terminator.  Actually should link to 
  ~/.config/terminator/config but renamed to disambiguate
xmonad.hs -- my configuration for the XMonad window manager.  Also for use in Gnome.
  It should live in ~/.xmonad
