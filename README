This is a collection of my dotfiles, created for getting a new computer up and
running quickly.  The intent is to check the folder out into my home direcotry,
and then create simlinks from actual dotfile locations to the contents of the
folder.

Feel free to use anything in here in any way, except to the extent that the
rc.lua is derived from a GPLed file.

Files:
rc.lua -- my configuration for the Awesome window manager.  For use as a WM
replacement in GNOME.
.vimrc -- vim configuartion
