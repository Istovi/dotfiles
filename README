This is a collection of my dotfiles and scripts, created for getting a new computer up and
running quickly.  The intent is to check the folder out into my home direcotry,
and then create simlinks from actual dotfile locations to the contents of the
folder as well as linking some scripts from ~/bin.

Feel free to use anything in here in any way, except to the extent that any
of these are GPL.
